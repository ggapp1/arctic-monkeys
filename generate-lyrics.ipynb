      "Youve never met before But still she greets you like a long lost rock n roll Shes definitely one of those Where youll go wherever she goes And with my body on my mind Both stop talking at the exact same time Trying to think of ways to make her mine But theyre difficult to find Its not what I need No your loves not what I need So dont give it to me And she said Oh well I know this will sound cold but I really have to go No its not that Im not free theres nowhere I need to be Its just your loves not what I need so dont give it to me Its not what I need No your loves not what I need So dont give it to me And she said Baby how can I believe you How can I believe you when you cant believe your luck No point sticking to the plan when its come unstuck Its more a hunger than a thirst Shell break your heart the second time Before you know about the first Looks well equipped to leave you in the lurch But youd let her do her worst And its not hard to tell Its obvious the other angels faces fell When she told him that she had to go Swapped her wings and overcoat for something colourful Tha knows Its not what I need No your loves not what I need So dont give it to me No your loves not what I need So dont give it to me No your loves not what I need So dont give it to me No your loves not what I need So dont give it to me Your loves not what I need In a foreign place the saving grace was the feeling That it was a heart that he was stealing Oh he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement The eyes are bright he couldnt wait to get away And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake Make no mistake no And even if somehow we could have Shown you the place you wanted Well Im sure you could have Made it that bit better on your own And I bet she told a million people that shed stay in touch But all the little promises they dont mean much When theres memories to be made And I hope youre holding hands by New Years Eve They made it far too easy to believe That true romance cant be achieved these days And even if somehow they could have Shown you the place you wanted Well Im sure you could have Made it that bit better on your own You are the only ones who know Arabellas got some interstellargator skin boots An a Helter Skelter round her little finger An I ride it endlessly Shes got a Barbarella silver swimsuit An when she needs to shelter from reality She takes a dip in my daydreams My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind That little lady sittin on the passenger side Its much less picturesque without her catchin the light The horizon tries but its just not as kind on the eyes As Arabella oh As Arabella PostChorus Just might ve tapped into your mind and soul You cant be sure Arabellas got a 70s head But shes a modern lover Its an exploration shes made of outer space An her lips are like the galaxys edge An her kiss the colour of a constellation Fallin into place My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind That little lady sittin on the passenger side Its much less picturesque without her catchin the light The horizon tries but its just not as kind on the eyes As Arabella oh As Arabella PostChorus Just might ve tapped into your mind and soul You cant be sure Thats magic In a cheetah print coat Just a slip Underneath it I hope Asking if I can have one of those Organic Cigarettes that she smokes Wraps her lips Round a Mexican Coke Makes you wish That you were the bottle Takes a sip Of your soul an it sounds like Guitar Solo Just might ve tapped into your mind and soul You cant be sure Get out the way mister With your short sharp tips No I wont read your lips right now And baby hey You send a shiver down my spine But do you read my mind Do you And youre looking pretty suspicious And probably planning a heist Hes wanting to go to the strippers It makes him feel all nice Cigarette smoke yeah The cigarette smoke in your eyes Watching a stripper and Smacking a bloke yeah Smacking a bloke here tonight Get out my way mister With your short sharp tips No I wont read your lips right now And baby hey You send a shiver down my spine But do you read my mind Do you Hes probably got stopped by a panda For speeding on his way there Flashing of digital cameras From tourists in Trafalgar Square Cigarette smoke yeah The cigarette smoke in your eyes Watching a stripper and Snortin some coke yeah Snortin some coke off her thighs Blahblahblahblahblahblah Cigarette smoke yeah The cigarette smoke in your eyes Watching a stripper and Smacking a bloke yeah Smacking a bloke here tonight And I just cant see for the Cigarette smoke yeah The cigarette smoke in your eyes Watching a stripper and Snortin some coke yeah Snortin some coke off her thighs Lalalalalala laaaaaaaoooo Owww Topless models doing Semaphore Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored Illuminations on a rainy day When she walks her footsteps sing a reckless serenade Ive been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need Called up to listen to the voice of reason And got the answering machine The type of kisses where teeth collide When she laughs the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when shes walking by Ive been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need Called up to listen to the voice of reason And got his answering machine I left my message but did he fuck get back to me And now Im stuck still wondering how its meant to be Singing a reckless serenade reckless serenade Reckless serenade reckless serenade Reckless serenade reckless serenade Reckless serenade Lately Ive been seeing things belly button piercings In the sky at night when were side by side And I dont mean to rain on anybodys cabriolet One of those games youre gonna lose But you wanna play it just in case Now its getting dark and the sky looks sticky More like black treacle than tar Black treacle Somebody told the stars youre not coming out tonight And so they found a place to hide Does it help you stay up late Does it help you concentrate Does it tune you in when you chew your chin Am I ruining your fun And you talk the talk alright But do you walk the walk or catch the train You wanted it you got it but you dont want it now Now its getting dark and the sky looks sticky More like black treacle than tar Black treacle Somebody told the stars youre not coming out tonight And so they found a place to hide Now Im out of place and Im not getting any wiser I feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesiser And I tried last night to pack away your laugh Like a key under the mat But it never seems to be there when you want it Black treacle Black treacle Black treacle I just wanted to be one of The Strokes Now look at the mess you made me make Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase Miles away from any halfuseful imaginary highway Im a big name in deep space ask your mates But golden boys in bad shape I found out the hard way that Here aint no place for dolls like you and me Everybodys on a barge Floating down the endless stream of great TV 1984 2019 PreChorus Maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s Rocketship grease down the cracks of my knuckles Karate bandana warp speed chic Hair down to there impressive moustache Love came in a bottle with a twistoff cap Lets all have a swig and do a hot lap So who you gonna call The Martini Police Baby that isnt how they look tonight oh no It took the light forever to get to your eyes I just wanted to be one of those ghosts You thought that you could forget And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror On a long drive from the back seat But its alright cause you love me And you recognise that it aint how it should be Your eyes are heavy and the weathers getting ugly So pull over I know the place Dont you know an apparition is a cheap date What exactly is it youve been drinking these days Jukebox in the corner Long Hot Summer Theyve got a film up on the wall and its dark enough to dance What do you mean youve never seen Blade Runner PreChorus Oh maybe I was a little too wild in the 70s Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer Elevator down to my makebelieve residency From the honeymoon suite Two shows a day four nights a week Easy money So who you gonna call The Martini Police So who you gonna call The Martini Police Oh baby that isnt how they look tonight It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes And as we gaze skyward aint it dark early Its the star treatment Yeah and as we gaze skyward aint it dark early Its the star treatment Its the star treatment The star treatment Fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes That you would rather be beside than in front of But shes never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares She swam out of tonights phantasm Grabbed my hand and made it very clear Theres absolutely nothing for us here Its a magnolia celebration to be attended on a Wednesday night Its better that than get a reputation as a miserable little tyke At least thats the conclusion she came to in this overture And the secret door swings behind us Shes saying nothing shes just giggling along Her arms were folded most indignant Not looking like she was soon to leave I had to squint in order to believe Then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf Im unveiling the unexpected I who was earlier reluctant Was suddenly embarrassed and corrected How could such a creature survive in such a habitat And the secret door swings behind us Shes saying nothing shes just giggling along Even if they were to find us I wouldnt notice Im completely occupied As all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes Ones you would rather be beside than in front of But shes never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares Fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence But youre daft to think shed care Fools on parade Fools on parade Fools on parade Conduct a singalong You got your HP Lovecraft Your Edgar Allan Poe You got your unkind of ravens And your murder of crows Catty eyelashes And your Dracula cape Been flashing tripleA

with death I saw you driving your Prius And even that was Munster Koachesque You watch Italian horror And you listen to the scores Leathercladded spike collared I want you down on all fours Cause

the daylight But baby Im willing to start Refrain Youre so dark Got your HP Lovecraft Your Edgar Allen Poe Got your unkind of ravens Got your murder of crows Youre so dark babe But I want you hard Youre so dark baby But I want you hard Youre so dark oh But I want you hard Youre so dark baby Do the bad thing Take off your wedding ring Oh it won t make it that much easier It might make it worse Oh the nights like a whirlwind somebodies girlfriend Talking to me but it s alright she s saying that he s not gonna Slap me or try to attack me he s not the jealous type And I only need to get half an excuse and I m away But when there s no excuses that s much easier to say I ve been before And all these capers make us too good for her to ignore See she s talking but i m not entirely sure ah Do the bad thing Aka off your wedding ring Oh it won t make it that much easier It might make it worse Oh a sudden disheartener somebodies partner s talking to me But i don t know that is what she is

big mistake for you to wait And have me waste your time really love it s fine I said really love it s fine And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy I knew before the invitation that there was this boy Oh but she carried on suggesting I struggled to refuse She said its the red wine this time but that is no excuse Jesus in the day spa filling out the information

thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed On the last of your pick and mix Said Youre mistaken if youre thinking That I havent been called cold before As you bit into your strawberry lace And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper Its all you had left and it was going to waste Your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning And how youd like to aggravate the icecream man On rainy afternoons The next time that I caught my own reflection It was on its way to meet you Thinking of excuses to postpone You never looked like yourself from the side But your profile could not hide The fact you knew I was approaching your throne With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache Stood and puffed your chest out like youd never lost a war And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw And your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning And how youd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons Uninviting but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are Crying Lightning Instrumental Break Your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning Crying Lightning Crying Lightning Crying Lightning Your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I hate that little game you had called Crying Sank into their calculations and snorted on a stench Of their arithmetic Look for the boy who was hanging his head low More trophies and ideas to follow their pretend With a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles Afterwards those spiky whispers said he brought his own rope And skipped the bits they loathed Didn t scramble to find a dock leaf and capture back our hope To advice his mind had closed He lost all of his foot holes And with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles Fell in the nettles fell in the nettles He was a toothpick and the garlic and the cinder upon the path Had failed to blunt or hinder the slow collapse And clinging to the door frame he was trapped Off to a reminder of where he had been With a smile in his pocket and a scowl on his face There was nowhere to flee so sat content in the nettles You got the lights on in the afternoon An the nights are drawn out long And you re kissin to cut through the gloom With a cough drop coloured tongue And you were sittin in the corner With the coats all piled high And I thought you might be mine In a small world on an exceptionally Rainy Tuesday night In the right place

might not be smitten for long If youre still sitting shell soon be smitten and gone When you leave us through the patient doors That rattle in your ear will be the sound of our applause Rapturous considered and due Oh the nasty laughter and desperate smirks Are tangled in the boredom where out brittle kisses lurk Well how can I believe you when you cant believe your luck And the shards of past attraction lie visible But shy and blunt and weak and worn Away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak Oh the shards of past attraction lie visible But shy and blunt and weak and worn Away by whining in the emery paper voice you use to speak In the trap You only want to be the first to laugh You only want to be the first in the sandtrap You only want to be the first to laugh And

policemen look annoyed Perhaps these are ones they should avoid Got a chase last night From men with truncheons dressed in hats We didnt do that much wrong Still ran away though for the laugh Just for the laugh And please just stop talking Cause they wont find us if you do Oh those silly boys in blue Well they wont catch me and you Have you been drinking son You dont look old enough to me Im sorry officer Is there a certain age youre supposed to be Cause nobody told me And up rolls the riot van And these lads just wind the coppers up They ask why they dont catch proper crooks They get their address and their names took But they couldnt care less Thrown in the riot van And all the coppers kicked him in And there was no way he could win Just had to take it on the chin Made me kiss ya with a whisper And violently you swung through unfamiliar tongue Couldnt listen to tradition Grab me by the wrist to silently insist And when Im in the confines of crawling walls You hold me in place The ripples on the ceiling the avenues Unsugared taste Well waste away the evening The afternoon and the afternoons hat Together well find something to direct some laughter at You stood shirtless and confident Listening to the fools tickling the rules Their obsessions followed patterns Sat upon their stools with their attitudes And when Im in the confines of crawling walls You hold me in place The ripples on the ceiling the avenues Unsugared taste Well waste away the evening The afternoon and the afternoons hat Together well find something to direct some laughter at Instrumental Break And when Im in the confines of crawling walls You hold me in place The ripples on the ceiling the avenues Unsugared taste Well waste away the evening The afternoon and the afternoons hat Together well find

exceeding Temptation the very thing that held her back Alex Turner I dont ever want to hate you So dont show me your bed The only roads are culdesacs The only ends are dead I dont ever want to hate you Its not part of the plan So keep your charm where I cant see it And your hands where I can Dizzee Rascal Yo its Rasc gettin dirtee stankin yeah We used to be in tight me and my naughty friends

tenthousand eyes in the line And you can swap jumpers and make another move Instilled in your brain youve got something to prove To all the smirking faces and the boys in black Why cant they be pleasant Why cant they have a laugh Hes got his hand in your chest he wants to give you a duff Well secretly I think they want you all to kick off They want arms flying everywhere And bottles as well

Said that girls a different girl to her you kissed last night You couldnt have done that on a Sunday Of course not Well Im so glad they turned us all away Well put it down to fate I thought a thousand million things That I could never think this morning Got too deep But how deep is too deep Last night what we talked about It made so much sense But now the haze has ascended It dont make no sense

pastures of boredom Out from the sea of discontent They come in packs like hungry hounds Up seekers of the dark enchantment They haunt the boulevards and bars They pray to wishing wells and stars They ride the hurricane of hope Not looking back but on they go Toward the distance and deceiving And all the while they keep believing They are special and apart The lovers the lovers of the heart the lovers And when they pair off two by two They feel they are the chosen few And though their beds are made of straw They feel like velvet in the night And so the night is never ending Its made of distance and pretending Coz theyre special and apart The lovers the lovers of the heart the lovers And when love goes away And when love goes Goodbye Catches in their throats like cotton Rises in their hearts like rain The good times suddenly are all forgotten The hunt begins again They search the subways and the streets Their faces tired like their feet Their bodies aching to be warm And so they hide behind the moon Their loneliness inside them growing But they take comfort in just knowing That they are special and apart The lovers the lovers of the heart the lovers And when love comes again And when love comes Hello Rises from their throats like singing Catches in their hearts like wind The good things Strangers in their arms are bringing Makes life all right again They turn their faces to the light No longer hiding in the night So unashamed and unafraid That they can face each others faults And though the waltz will have its ending There is no harm in just pretending That they are special and apart The lovers the lovers of the heart the lovers You thrive on dancing in our laps before the more familiar chaps Who know the curtain leads to fever We watched the womaniser cry and in the last sip You and I declared we might require a breather I am the truths true truant I can feign excitement Fluently as solid as I can busk shock With wellpresented merriment and I know all too well I shouldnt break the key off in the lock And the tumble splits the frame Revealing silk and fits In the fright lined dining room Throw a gaze towards them while they feast The days drag their heels when youre not there to crack the whip And the weeks wait to burst like a sachet of brats The old pantomime villain follows my coat And he hides where it hangs and he spies through the slats And meanwhile in the deserts only costume shop The cowls hang and wait to rot away the identities of the willing So Im back to sugar in the night Rocketing shutter doors despite the shop not opening for hours You can itch flap and whistle and try to avoid the tock As I scribbled over drivel you were snoring showing off The tumble splits the frame Revealing silk and fits In the fright lined dining room Throw a gaze towards them while they feast Ladies youre damn right you cant read a mans mind Were living in two tribes and heading for war Well nobodys perfect weve all gotta work it But fellas were worth it so dont break the law Your calls late big mistake You gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take Next time read my mind and Ill be good to you Were giftwrapped kitty cats Were only

Loving me is as easy as pie Ai Im just a love machine feeding my fantasy Give me a kiss or three and Im fine I need a squeeze a day stead of this negligee What will the neighbors say this time Ive been going crazy while you sleep Thinking of a language that the two of us can speak So Mr Prehistoric make your wheel And Ill breathe underwater cause I like the way it feels I said your calls late big mistake You gotta hang about in limbo for as long as I take Next time read my mind and Ill be good to you Were giftwrapped kitty cats Were only turning into tigers when we gotta fight back Lets go Eskimo out into the blue Come take my hand understand that you can Youre my man and I need you tonight Come make my dreams honey hard as it seems Loving me is as easy as pie Im just a love machine feeding my fantasy Give me a kiss or three and Im fine I need a squeeze a day stead of this negligee What will the neighbors say this time Oh its very new Can anybody tell me what to do Oh this feelings very strange Can anybody tell me whats your game Oh A little education Oh To give you motivation Oh Well turn the situation round Oh Oh Oh Making you a stranger Oh Ill only rearrange ya for

Nice try You cannot turn away but nice try Turned your legs to little building blocks And with his index finger flicks you on your socks I go highpitched Hell talk and make your voice sound highpitched Dread to think if he got you on your own And whispered in your ear in that baritone Its the same stone His heart was cut out of the same stone That they used to carve his jaw Its impossible not to feel inferior And he could catapult you back to your daddy Or into any hissing misery And he will tell you how the day after a triumph Is as hollow as the day after a tragedy Hell extinguish any chance of escape When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape And hes leaving without saying bye Instrumental Break And you will queue up to listen to him pissing And hang around to watch some poor girl blub And then they chase him down the avenue Incessantly pestering him to let him join the club He knows how to put a cork in the fuss And just how to shut up the charming ones of us And Ive seen him talking to your lady friend Theres a dust track waiting for betrayal Where hell teach you all the bits they missed Nice try you cannot turn away but nice try Nice try you cannot turn away but nice try Nice try you cannot turn away but nice try Nice try you cannot turn away but nice try You cannot turn away One look sends it coursing through the veins Oh how the feeling races

Ill agree Cause when it comes to acting up Im sure I could write the book And now that youre more than a part in the play Its slightly easier to think what to say You had us all standing on our heads doing our best tricks yeah Never again well never again no Will there be another one quite as desirable as you One look sends it coursing through the veins Oh how the feeling races Back up to their brains to form expressions on their stupid faces Fake tales of San Francisco Echo through the room More point to a wedding disco Without a bride or groom And theres a super cool band yeah With their trilbies and their glasses of white wine And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets Practicing their lines I dont want to hear you kick me out kick me out I dont want to hear you no kick me out

script Dipped in the sort of talk to make you keep the gaze Its all a trick The slicked back slimy arms have got a war to wage Hes got a laugh like a crackling wire And he wants to put the bite marks on you He wants to put the bite marks on you And he twists my guts As the only thing thats repelling as his invitations Are his excuses And he said I am the conductor Put me in a terror pocket He did a stint Master in a craft Hed squint through his spectacle Hed drop a dirty hint if he thinks that he could impress you with the unacceptable And he has turned through all the pages with his fingers And covered them with goo And he wants to put the bite marks on you He wants to put them on you and it hurts my back Because the only thing thats as heavy as the adoration Is the days of hanging out on his lawn And he spilled without a sounding alarm And he frightened me to death When he said I am the conductor A pussyfooting setting sun Make a wish that weighs a tonne There are no handles for

In which I could believe But the hand of harsh realitys ungloved And its on its way back here to scoop you up But not on my watch I want to stay with you my love The way some science fiction does Reflections in the silver screen of strange societies Swamp monster with a hardon for connectivity The ascension of the CREAM Mass panic on a not too distant future colony Quantitative easing I want to make a simple point about peace and love But in a sexy way where its not obvious Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages The way some science fiction does The way some science fiction does Got the world on a wire In my little mirror mirror on the wall In the pocket of my raincoat So I tried to write a song to make you blush But Ive a feeling that the whole thing May well just end up too clever for its own good The way some science fiction does Blind faith heartache Mind games mistakes My sweet fireball My sweet rigmarole I want it all I want it all Old dogs new tricks Can you feel it Space age country girl Stone cold miracle I want it all I want it all And then suddenly it hit me it s a year ago Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your Coke Said ain t it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road Leave me listening to the Stones 2000 Light Years From Home Shoowop shoowop shoowop shoowop Shoowop shoowop shoowop shoowop Shoowop shoowop shoowop shoowop Shoowop shoowop shoowop shoowop Shoowop shoowop I want it all I want it all I want it all I want it all I want it all Well ask if we can have six in If not well have to have two Well youre coming up at our end arent you So Ill get one with you Wont he let us have six in Especially not with the food He could have just told us no though He didnt have to be rude You see her with the green dress She talked to me at the bar Well how come its already twopound fifty Weve only gone about a yard Didnt you see she were gorgeous She were beyond belief But this lad at the side drinking his Smirnoff Ice Came and paid for her Tropical Reef And Im sitting going backwards And I didnt want to leave I said Its High Green mate Via Hillsborough please Well how funny were that sketch earlier Up near that taxi rank Oh no you would have missed it Think it were when you went to the bank These two lads squaring up proper shouting Bout who were next in the queue The kind of thing thatd seem so silly But not when theyve both had a few Well calm down temper temper You shouldnt get so annoyed Well youre acting like a silly little boy Oh they wanted to be men And do some fighting in the street He said No surrender No chance of retreat Instrumental Break And so why are they in the taxi Cause I didnt want to leave I said Its High Green mate Via Hillsborough please Drunken plots hatched to jump it Ask around Are you sure Went for it but the red light was showing And red light indicates doors are secure He looks as if he hasnt slept His hair is purposely unkept In many doorways people wept When you crafted your plan Shadows underneath the eyes And everywhere the bastard lies My lack of proof is your disguise You wont remember me PreChorus Theres nothing really I can say But Sorry mate and walk away I could be wrong on this you play your game This world is full of most unkind And horrible is redefined I cant imagine that youd mind at all Youre lying again your conscience isnt your friend And the only thing youre sobbing at is your imagination Lying again your conscience isnt your friend And the only thing youre sobbing at is your imagination Is he really on the street Desperation or deceit And what hes wearing on his feet Wont solve our mystery And I am baffled by how you stand there soaking it in And do you hide your identity where you hide your grin Youd better hide your grin 4 Shadows underneath the eyes And everywhere the bastard lies My lack of proof is your disguise You wont remember me PreChorus Theres nothing really I can say But sorry mate and walk away I could be wrong unless you play your game This world is full of most unkind And horrible is redefined I cant imagine that youd mind at all Youre lying again your conscience isnt your friend And the only thing youre sobbing at is your imagination Lying again your conscience isnt your friend And the only thing youre sobbing at is your imagination Outside the cafe by the cracker factory You were practicing a magic trick And my thoughts got rude As you talked and chewed On the last of your pick and mix Said Youre mistaken if your thinking that I havent been called cold before As you bit into your strawberry lace And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper Is all you have left and it was going to waste Your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning And how you like to aggravate the icecream man on rainy afternoons The next time that I caught my own reflection It was on its way to meet you Thinking of excuses to postpone You never looked like yourself from the side But your profile could not hide The fact you knew I was approaching your throne With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache Stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war And though I try so not to suffer the indignity of reaction There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw Your pastimes consisted of the strange And twisted and deranged And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons Uninviting But not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are Crying Lightning Oh you were reading a book about some idiot and telling me about another I was so severely underwhelmed I thought I might never recover Straighten the rudder girl and sail me up stairs And go and find somebody who cares Well we might not be the perfect partners but tonight we make a pair Crying Lightning Crying Lightning Crying Lightning Crying Lightning Crying Your love is like a studded leather headlock Your kiss it could put creases in the rain Youre rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock And those other girls are just postmix lemonade Suck it and see you never know Sit next to me before I go Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes Be cruel to me cause I am a fool for you I poured my aching heart into a pop song I couldnt get the hang of poetry Thats not a skirt girl thats a sawnoff shotgun And I can only hope youve got it aimed at me Suck it and see you never know Sit next to me before I go Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes Be cruel to me cause I am a fool for Blue moon girls from once upon a ShangriLa How I often wonder where you are You have got that face that just says Baby I was made to break your heart ohohoh Suck it and see you never know Sit next to me before I go go go go Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes Be cruel to me cause I am a fool for you I cant explain but I wanna try Theres this image of you and I And it goes dancing by In the morning and in the night time Theres all these secrets that I cant keep Like in my heart theres that hotel suite And you lived there so long Its kind of strange now youre gone Im not sure if I should show you what Ive found Has it gone for good or is it coming back around Isnt it hard to make up your mind When youre losing and your fuse is fireside Theres all those places we used to go And I suspect you already know But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same But something about its changed Im not sure if I should show you what Ive found Has it gone for good or is it coming back around Isnt it hard to make up your mind When youre losing and your fuse is fireside And I thought I was yours forever Or maybe I was mistaken But I just cannot manage to make it through the day Without thinking of you lately Instrumental Break Im not sure if I should show you what Ive found Has it gone for good or is it coming back around Isnt it hard to make up your mind When youre losing and your fuse is fireside The smiles as she walked in the room Have all turned into frowns Am I too quick to assume that the love is no longer in bloom The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune To what they did before her heads red raw And the ending doesnt sound like the happiest around When you sobbed before It felt much more like the product of a squabble Now theres reason for it to be something more And there would be oh its uncertain Whether the curtain has shut for good She said See if its still raining Im not dressed for it And If you loved me And I interrupted received a scowl and stare But still decided to stop her there Would it be outrageous to say Were either shouting or were shagging Docked in tempestuous bays Or at least thats how it felt yesterday The eyes are getting heavier And whether youre asleep or awake Is a mystery Would a kiss be too much to ask When you fit me As Sundays frozen pitch fits the thermos flask Its a pity It just hit me we cant go back To the chest touching on the back Open Sesame Weve places to go Weve people to see Lets put em on hold Theres all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make When you want to escape say the word PreChorus Well I know that getting you alone isnt easy to do With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room And I dont wanna lie but I dont wanna tell you the truth Get the sense that youre on the move And youll probably be leaving soon so Im telling you Stop the world cause I wanna Get off with you Stop the world cause I wanna Get off with you Eyes the colour of Water left in mud Icing sugar dust Crazy green flashes Its a funny thing that I cannot explain Dont you know the train keeps arolling Stop the world cause I wanna Get off with you Stop the world cause I wanna Get off with you Instrumental Break PreChorus Well I know that getting you alone isnt easy to do And I dont wanna lie and I dont wanna tell you the truth And I know we got places to go we got people to see Think we both oughta put em on hold and I know you agree Stop the world cause I wanna Get off with you Stop the world cause I wanna Get off with you You push the button and well do the rest The exotic sound of data storage Nothing like it first thing in the morning You push the button and well do the rest Bastard Latin thats the best thing for it You push the button and well do the rest PreChorus You and Lizzy in the summertime Wrapping my tiny mind around a lullaby There are things that I just cannot explain to you And those that I hope I dont ever have to Pattern language in the mood for love You push the button and well do the rest PreChorus You and Genie wearing Stetson hats Trying to gain access to my lily pad There are things that I just cannot explain to you And those that I hope I dont ever have to The worlds first ever monster truck front flip Im just a bad girl trying to be good Ive got a laser guiding my love that I cannot adjust Forwardthinking model villages More brain shrinking moving images You push the button and well do the rest Hes pining for her in a people carrier There might be buildings and pretty things to see like that but architecture wont do Although it might say a lot about the city or town I dont care what theyve got keep on turning em down It dont say the funny things she does Dont even try and cheer him up because it just wont happen Hes got the feeling again this time on the aeroplane There might be tellies in the back of the seats in front but Rodney and Del wont do Although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains Laugh when he falls through the bar but youre feeling the same Cause she isnt there to hold your hand She wont be waiting for you when you land And it feels like shes just nowhere near You could well be out on your ear This thought comes closely followed by the fear And the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill Yesterday I saw a girl who looked like someone you might knock about with And almost shouted And then reality kicked in within us it seems as we become the winners You lose a bit of summat and half wonder if you won it at all And dont say owt cause youve got no idea And shes still nowhere near And the thought comes closely followed by the fear And the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill Despair in the departure lounge Its one and theyll still be around at three No signal and low battery Whats happened to me I wish you would have smiled in the bakery Or sat on a tatty settee At a mutual friends gathering And the more you keep on looking the more its hard to take Love were in stalemate To never meet is surely where were bound Theres one in every town Just there to grind you down I wish I would have seen you in the post office Well maybe I did and I missed it Too busy with the mind on clever lines Why not the rounders pitch or the canteen Youre slacking love where have you been Just had to go and wait until tonight To give me the invite Dont worry its alright I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade Sipping on a lemonade In the paper cup and chewing on the straw And I wish Id seen you in the bakery But if Id seen you in the bakery You probably wouldnt have seen me Stop making the eyes at me Ill stop making the eyes at you What it is that surprises me is that I dont really want you to PreChorus And your shoulders are frozen Cold as the night Oh but youre an explosion Youre dynamite Your name isnt Rio but I dont care for sand And lighting the fuse might result in a bang bbbangoh I bet that you look good on the dancefloor I dont know if youre looking for romance or I dont know what youre looking for I said I bet that you look good on the dancefloor Dancing to electropop like a robot from 1984 Well from 1984 I wish youd stop ignoring me because its sending me to despair Without a sound yeah youre calling me and I dont think its very fair PreChorus That your shoulders are frozen Cold as the night Oh but youre an explosion Youre dynamite Your name isnt Rio but I dont care for sand And lighting the fuse might result in a bang bbbangoh I bet that you look good on the dancefloor I dont know if youre looking for romance or I dont know what youre looking for I said I bet that you look good on the dancefloor Dancing to electropop like a robot from 1984 Well from 1984 And no there int no love no Montagues or Capulets Just banging tunes and DJ sets and Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness Well I bet that you look good on the dancefloor I dont know if youre looking for romance or I dont know what youre looking for I said I bet that you look good on the dancefloor Dancing to electropop like a robot from 1984 Said from 1984 Betwixt and between the fantastic dream and the fear Do you wonder where she is this afternoon And does it get on your nerves make you slightly perturbed That theres things that you dont know about her And even the places that shes never been with you Seem awful empty without her You cant look into those eyes Down no telephone line What if you were right first time You cant look into those eyes Down no telephone line What if you were right first time Instrumental Break Betwixt and between the fantastic dream and the fear Do you wonder where she is this afternoon And with the needle in groove is there owt to prove And tell me are your feet still tapping I know there s a first for a trip over the water What is the worst that could happen You cant look into those eyes Down no telephone line What if you were right first time Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now Or darling have you started feeling old yet Dont worry Im sure that youre still breaking hearts With the efficiency that only youth can harness And do you still think love is a laserquest Or do you take it all more seriously Ive tried to ask you this in some daydreams that Ive had But youre always busy being makebelieve And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself youre there Or have somebodys goodnight kisses got that covered When Im not being honest I pretend that you were just some lover Now I cant think of air without thinking of you I doubt that comes as a surprise And I cant think of anything to dream about I cant find anywhere to hide And when Im hanging on by the rings around my eyes And I convince myself I need another And for a minute it gets easy To pretend that you were just some lover Instrumental break When Im pipe and slippers and rocking chair Singing dreadful songs about summer Will I have found a better method of Pretending you were just some lover Will I have found a better method of Pretending you were just some lover I said I wanted it long but she cut it short And now Im catching a cold I told you not but no crack in the doobie But it was already rolled Oh I turned down my lights And my curtains werent closed I turned down my lights And my curtains werent closed Oh well I turned down my lights And my curtains werent closed last night Oh baby I must be mad Well I dont care about your massage oils Its got my skin going red Cause Im a mad motherfucker With my curtains open Sitting tucked up in bed I turned down my lights And my curtains werent closed I turned down my lights And my curtains werent closed Oh well I turned down my lights And my curtains werent closed last night Oh baby I must be mad 007 and Brucey Wayne Are shitting them sens because theres another name Coming to claim what is his to claim Ten percent faster with a sturdier frame Hes certainly come into his own Theres one on his arm in every land that he roams And two consecutive nights alone Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing Drawing you in like its boring to him Its a war you cant win and the first and the last Are two things youll never be my darling Another roll around and another push and shove Further away from the idea of love And his conclusion it must be good Or when the penny has dropped with an incredible thud Forgot to kick the tin He knows where shes going but dont know where shes been And as opposed to the other thing Hell worry about it when its trouble hes in They said he looks so handsome stood not dancing Drawing you in like its boring to him Its a war you cant win and the first and the last Are two things youll never be my darling Two things youll never be my darling Two things you will never be my darling Two things youll never be my darling Well he sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat uplines Not to feel like a twat at times its hard But not for this kid not when they come to you Darlin tell me something I don t know Be my baby be my GTO Call me something no one else calls me I forget how I want it that electricity Well my heart was breaking and got left unlocked Didn t see you sneak in but I m glad you stopped Tell me something I don t already know Like howd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity Love like locked horns love like dominos Be my midnight be my ebb and flow I forget how I want it how it crept up on me It takes over electricity And my heart was breaking and got left unlocked Didn t see you sneak in but I m glad you stopped Tell me something I don t already know Like howd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity Separated there I face it Love like thunder love like falling snow Tell me something I don t already know Like howd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity Watch me watch me go Well Im struttin up ever so slow And now sting me get in the groove Cause theyre bangin on the door Yes theyre hard and theyll make a move Were wakin up those sleepers You know were so mischievous Just what youll do to keep us entertained Were wakin up those sleepers You know were so mischievous Just what youll do to keep us entertained Hook Knock run Shes got you up and shes run run runnin away Knock run Youre knockin first if you think that youre comin to play And I dont mind Cause all the time youre talkin at me No I dont mind at all Oh well capguns and polystyrene planes Well Im buyin penny bubblies with my change Cause sting me get in the groove Cause theyre bangin on the door Yes theyre hard and theyll make a move Were wakin up those sleepers You know were so mischievous Just what youll do to keep us entertained Well now she said shes going Shes got the towel to throw in Was just about to blow him and ran away Hook When I got back from fixing my hair You were directing the traffic Letting your story slip on the snow As if the transmission was automatic Its arguable that I shouldntve been there It was fortunate timing I had a hole in the pocket of my favourite coat And my love dropped into the lining Have you got your strange Not on me I havent got my strange Have you got your strange Not on me You cant sleep until youve sat on the steps to weep Til you feel like youve wept yeah As long as you dont forget your strange Have you got your strange No not on me I havent got my strange Have you got your strange Not on me I havent got my strange Ive better fetch my strange I havent got my strange I havent got my strange Im going back to 505 If its a sevenhour flight or a fortyfiveminute drive In my imagination youre waiting lying on your side With your hands between your thighs Stop and wait a sec When you look at me like that my darling what did you expect Id probably still adore you with your hands around my neck Or I did last time I checked Not shy of a spark A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark Frightened by the bite though its no harsher than the bark The middle of adventure such a perfect place to start Im going back to 505 If its a sevenhour flight or a fortyfiveminute drive In my imagination youre waiting lying on your side With your hands between your thighs Instrumental Break But I crumble completely when you cry It seems like once again youve had to greet me with Goodbye Im always just about to go and spoil a surprise Take my hands off of your eyes too soon Im going back to 505 If its a sevenhour flight or a fortyfive minute drive In my imagination youre waiting lying on your side With your hands between your thighs and a smile Lady where has your love gone I was looking but cant find it anywhere They always offer when theres loads of love around But when youre short of some its nowhere to be found Well I know your game you told him yesterday No chance youll get nothing from me But now shes there youre there and everybodys there Hes in turmoil as puzzled as can be just like me Lets go down down low down Where I know I should not go Oh and she you think shes the one But shes just one in twentyfour And just cause everybodys doing it Does that mean that I can too Lady where has your love gone It was the antiseptic to the sore To hold you by the hand Must you first be in demand How he longs for you to long for him once more Just once more Lets go down down low down Where I know I should not go Oh and she you think shes the one But shes just one in twentyfour And just cause everybodys doing it Does that mean that I can too Oh her eyes went down and cut you up And theres nothing like a dirty look from The one you want or the one youve lost An ache in your soul its everybodys goal To get what they cant have Thats why youre after her and thats why shes after him But saying it wont change a thing And theyll realise that it wont change a thing Realise that it wont change a thing Running off over next doors garden before the hour is done Its more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun The confidence is the balaclava Im sure youll baffle em good Will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone Or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned And youll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish youd never been born You tie yourself to the tracks and there isnt no going back And its wrong wrong wrong but well do it anyway cause we love a bit of trouble Are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start The confidence is the balaclava Im sure youll baffle em straight And its wrong wrong wrong but she can hardly wait Thats right he wont let her out his sight Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn Whos the crooks in this crime Thats right he wont let her out his sight Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn Whos the crooks in this crime Instrumental break Thats right he wont let her out his sight Thats right he wont let her out his sight Thats right he wont let her out his sight Well youll be able to boast Of the day of the most flawless heist of all time You knew that itd be trouble right before the very first kiss Quiet and unassuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest She pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought But sorry sweetheart Id much rather keep on the balaclava The painted faces congregate in the mating season To second homes they go alone in no rush to leave them Refrain And theres a fountain and a scimitarshaped yellow light And it picks you up and cuts you down to size When the people there and the furniture start to seem important When a moment more when you catch the floor With a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc Refrain Like the scimitarshaped yellow light That picks you up and cuts you down to size Well I had questions for the tap dancer sat on my lap And she had childproof caps on her answers Stone blower blow me a stone And show me that handsome enhancer She had a rock on her throttle And a brown glass bottle full of shavings from the sun Although those shoes affect your step Dont forget whose legs youre on Refrain And theres a fountain and a scimitarshaped yellow light And it picks you up and it cuts you down to size Richard Hawley I like the way you look at me baby Please dont try to turn out the lights I act as if Im not going crazy But girl Im in a muddle tonight Would you tell me where youre gonna take it If I had a heart youre the one who should break it The engines running Cant decide if I should ride away Richard Hawley Alex Turner You and I You and I Richard Hawley I had a woman she went away And now Im lonely Fuck it Richard Hawley Alex Turner You and I You and I You and I You and I Instrumental Break Richard Hawley Would you tell me where youre gonna take it If I had a heart youre the one who should break it The engines running Cant decide if I should ride away Richard Hawley Alex Turner You and I You and I You and I You and I You and I You and I Richard Hawley I like the way you look at me baby Please dont try to turn out the lights I act as if Im not going crazy But girl Im in a muddle tonight Well the mourning was complete When there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat Several hours or several weeks Id have the cheek to say theyre equally as bleak Its the beginning of the end The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend Ask anyone theyll tell you that its these times that it tends To start to break in half to start to fall apart hold on to your heart And do me a favour and break my nose Or do me a favour and tell me to go away Or do me a favour and stop asking questions She walked away while her shoes were untied And the eyes were all red you could see that wed cried And I watched and I waited til she was inside Forcing a smile and waving goodbye Curiosity becomes a heavy load Too heavy to hold too heavy to hold Curiosity becomes a heavy load Too heavy to hold will force you to be cold Do me a favour and ask if you need some help She said Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself And to tear apart the ties that bind Perhaps Fuck off might be too kind Perhaps Fuck off might be too kind Shes been thinking well fuck it all were not going home today And shes been eating too much magic beans to walk home anyway And you cant fool me come down to the dirty ground Put up your picture and the playful word will get around Yeah word will get around yeah Yeah word will get around Hook Everyones feeling alright I wont be sleeping today I wont be sleeping tonight Feeling silly feeling oh so sick And I cant see you through the smoke because the clouds so thick And theres a fire as youre dancing to the disco sound Put up your picture baby and word will get around Yeah word will get around yeah Yeah word will get around Hook Everyones feeling alright I wont be sleeping today I wont be sleeping tonight Im in a vest Library pictures of the quickening canoe The first of its kind to get to the moon Trust some ellipses to chase you round the room Through curly straws and metaphors and goo Been watching all the neon blossom flickering You look as if youve all forgotten where youve been Going riding through the thunder suckle fuzz canyon Ten nine eight seven six five four three two one Library pictures of the quickening canoe The first of its kind to get to the moon Give me an eeny meeny miny moe Or an ip dip dog shit rock and roll I said whos that girl there I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets She dont do major credit cards I doubt she does receipts Its all not quite legitimate And what a scummy man Just give him half a chance I bet hell rob you if he can Can see it in his eyes yeah that hes got a driving ban Amongst some other offences And Ive seen him with girls of the night And he told Roxanne to put on her red light Theyre all infected but hell be alright Cause hes a scumbag dont you know I said hes a scumbag dont you know Instrumental Although youre trying not to listen Avert your eyes and staring at the ground She makes a subtle proposition Im sorry love Ill have to turn you down And oh he must be up to summat What are the chances Sure its more than likely Ive got a feeling in my stomach And start to wonder what his story might be What his story might be yeah Cause they said it changes when the sun goes down Yeah they said it changes when the sun goes down And they said it changes when the sun goes down Around here around here Look here comes a Ford Mondeo Isnt he Mr Inconspicuous And he dont even have to say owt Shes in the stance ready to get picked up Bet shes delighted when she sees him Pulling in and giving her the eye Because she must be fucking freezing Scantilyclad beneath the clear night sky It dont stop in the winter no And they said it changes when the sun goes down Yeah they said it changes when the sun goes down And they said it changes when the sun goes down Around here Well they said it changes when the sun goes down Over the river going out of town And they said it changes when the sun goes down Around here around here oh And what a scummy man Just give him half a chance I bet hell rob you if he can Can see it in his eyes yeah that hes got a nasty plan I hope youre not involved at all Ive seen your eyes as they fix on me What is he doing What on earths the plan has he got one You better give me some pointers Since you are the big rocket launcher and Im just the shotgun I aint got no dollar signs in my eyes That might be a surprise but its true said Im not like you And I dont want your advice or your praise Or to move in the ways you do and I never will Cause all you people are vampires And all your stories are stale And though you pretend to stand by us I know youre certain well fail Ive seen your eyes as they fix on me full of confusion Your snarl is just so condescending Trying to explain that were on to a win If the fee we get in near recoups what were spending He said I cant believe that you drove all that way Well how much did they pay ya How much did they pay ya Youd have been better to stay round our way Thinking about things but not actually doing the things Cause all you people are vampires And all your stories are stale And though you pretend to stand by us I know youre certain well fail Cause all you people are vampires And all your stories are stale And though you pretend to stand by us I know youre certain well fail Instrumental break Shouted All you people are vampires Trudging through the morning The tramp with the trampoline under his arm Shifts past your whiskers so stark is the charm But the barking alarm waits coiled til the corner is turned And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move round In your muddy mind blatantly caked and Unwilling to wind uncooperative time So he sits on the springs til the muck goes dry All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the What came first the chicken or the dickhead Split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts And twilight forced you to go on a walk Your legs start running and your leg gets caught Canopy 19 is perfectly placed For the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste Youll have to slip away I am unhappy to say Behold as the crook in the hammock plays All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall Behold as a crook in the hammock plays Cruelly with the base and the scales And fiddles with her feet on a balancing act Gagged bound and crafting a tale Trailing wrapped in a gasp Cruelly with the base and the scales And fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act She was gagged bound and crafting a tale Trailing wrapped in a gasp All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall Just another microcosm somewhere in the ether Putting the world to rights with Bing Crosby eyes Oversharing and its bitter aftertaste Exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place Save it for a rainy day Baby you go hard in the paint Its just another race to anyways Philanthropic toga party What a place for both the opposite sides of my double life to finally collide Sharing secrets I was taking to the grave Nosebleeds from epiphanies I took full in the face Oh come all by the fire babe let s all participate In yet another race to anyways Oh hows your Mum and Dad been doing with the generation gap Yeah Im behind my movie camera I ve got my megaphone You can call me Alexander Its nice to meet you all Listening to the Shipping Forecast Driving to the airport Me and the guys Metropolis ablaze in the rear view Devising methods to both have and eat your cake Mmm just like the ones that Mother Nature used to bake You look as if you know exactly what Im gonna say Its just another race to Anyways Sketchead is coming to your party Hes walking up your drive and hes swinging all his keys around Sketchead hes seen you with your top off He already knows your boyfriend retain your introductions Sketchead that cumbersome protagonist The pips in your quince the eye behind the spy hole The itch you cant itch in your ear And the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints Sketchead theres poison in his spit Hell compliment your tits and leave you to your wits Sketchead convincingly insisting the tyres were bald When you gave him the car Sketchead still coming to your party Still walking up your drive and still swinging all his keys around On his finger as a pendulum to unnerve And then theres you youve changed I approached you like you were the same But soon it was apparent a new name was required New lips went and fired accomplishments at me While Im captivated by your magazine skin The tint on your lenses obscures to begin And you know full well That anyone who says that they dont prefer the sequel Will still be swinging on themselves tonight Well the times are slowly changing baby even when its live You can press pause and rewind You knew itd go amazing but is this what you had in mind Oh theres nothing you cant find Its two thousand and thirteen all across the galaxy Its two thousand and thirteen On the back of a transmitter theres a little shiny fruit And its coming after you As for Instagram and Twitter she got caught in both lassoes And neither one will cut her loose Its two thousand and thirteen all across the galaxy Its two thousand and thirteen So baby take a walk with me Past flying cars and time machines Theres magic like you wont believe Its two thousand and thirteen all across the galaxy Its two thousand and thirteen Do the bad thing Take off your wedding ring But it wont make it that much easier It might make it worse Oh the nights like a whirlwind Somebodys girlfriends talking to me but its alright Shes saying that hes not gonna slap me or try to attack me Hes not the jealous type And I only need to get half an excuse and Im away But when theres no excuses thats much easier to say Ive been before And all these capers make us to look for it to ignore See shes talking but Im not entirely sure Do the bad thing Take off your wedding ring But it wont make it that much easier It might make it worse Oh a sudden disheartener Somebodys partners talking to me But I dont know that is what she isnt She murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true And I knew how could she not She could have anyone she wants And Im struggling to think of an immediate response Like I dont mind itd be a big mistake for you to wait And let me waste your time Really love its fine I said Really love its fine Instrumental break And then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy I knew before the invitation that there was this ploy Oh but she carried on suggesting a struggle to refuse She said Its the red wine this time but that is no excuse You used to get it in your fishnets Now you only get it in your night dress Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness Landed in a very common crisis Everythings in order in a black hole Nothing seems as pretty as the past though That Bloody Marys lacking in Tabasco Remember when you used to be a rascal Oh the boys a slag the best you ever had The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams But not as daft as they seem not as daft as they seem My love when you dream them up Flicking through a little book of sex tips Remember when the boys were all electric Now when shes told shes gonna get it Im guessing that shed rather just forget it Clinging to not getting sentimental Said she wasnt going but she went still Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil Oh the boys a slag the best you ever had The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams Werent daft as they seem not as daft as they seem My love when you dream them up Oh Flo where did you go Where did you go Where did you go Youre falling about You took a left off Last Laugh Lane Just sounding it out But youre not coming back again Youre falling about You took a left off Last Laugh Lane You were just sounding it out But youre not coming back again You used to get it in your fishnets Falling about Now you only get it in your night dress Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness You took a left off Last Laugh Lane Landed in a very common crisis Everythings in order in a black hole You were just sounding it out Is anything as pretty in the past though That Bloody Marys lacking in Tabasco Youre not coming back again Remember when you used to be a rascal Oh Still got pictures of friends on the wall I suppose we arent really friends anymore Maybe I shouldnt ever have called that thing friendly at all Get freaked out from a knock at the door When I havent been expecting one And didnt that used to be part of the fun once upon a time Well be there at the back of the bar In a booth like we usually were Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event What a death I died writing that song Start to finish with you looking on It stays between us Steinway and his sons Cause its the ultracheese Perhaps its time that you went for a walk Dressed like a fictional character From a place they called America in the golden age Trust the politics to come along When you were just tryna orbit the sun When you were just about to be kind to someone Because you had the chance Ive still got pictures of friends on the wall I might look as if Im deep in thought But the truth is Im probably not If I ever was Oh the dawn wont stop weighing a tonne Ive done some things that I shouldnt have done But I havent stopped loving you once I was biting the time zone And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams And threw caution to the colourful Then we fell asleep in the car Until the bumps woke me up in your grip And the tide took me to your mouth And then swept me back down to your palms Its them that put me inside the reminder That yours is the only ocean Yours is the only ocean That I wanna swing from Yours is the only ocean That I wanna hang on Ive got this ego mechanic Shes always trying to give me vitamins Ah shed be frightened of your reflection I preferred her as a cartoon If I could be someone else for a week Id spend it chasing after you Cause shes not shattering my attitudes No matter how she folds the potion Yours is the only ocean Yours is the only ocean That I wanna swing from Yours is the only ocean That I want to hang on to Potion approaching shield your eyes Potion approaching visualise Holding a token swollen in size Potion approaching shield your eyes Oh but if were gonna escape though We really ought to think it through Would you like me to build you a gokart Instrumental version of Sandtrap Just when things are getting complicated in the eye of

In our minds for days and weeks and months I was that amazed and there she stayed Surrounded by the What ifs and the Maybes Instrumental I thought I saw you in the Battleship But it was only a lookalike She was nothing but a vision trick Under the warning light She was close close enough to be your ghost But my chances turned to toast When I asked her if I could call her your name I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook Huddled up in a wicker chair I wandered over for a closer look And kissed whoever was sitting there She was close and she held me very tightly Til I asked awfully politely Please can I call you her name And I elongated my lift home Yeah I let him go the long way round I smelt your scent on the seatbelt And kept my shortcuts to myself I thought I saw you in the Parrots Beak Messing with the smoke alarm It was too loud for me to hear her speak And she had a broken arm It was close so close that the walls were wet And she wrote it out in Letraset No you cant call me her name Tell me wheres your hiding place Im worried Ill forget your face And Ive asked everyone Im beginning to think I imagined you all along I elongated my lift home Yeah I let him go the long way

No intention of a wedding Hes pinched your bird And hed probably kick your head in Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts Youre better off without her anyway You said you wasnt sad to see her go Of course you were Have you heard what shes been doing Never did it for me He picks her up at the school gates At twenty past three Shes been with all the boys But never went very far She wagged English and Science Just to go in his car PreChorus Theyve got engaged No intention of a wedding Hes pinched my bird And hed probably kick my head in oh Now the girls have grown But Im sure they still carry on in similar ways Bigger Boys and Stolen Sweethearts So Im better off without her anyway I said I wasnt sad to see her go But Im only pretending you know Yeah Im only pretending you know Yeah Im only pretending you know Oh Im only pretending you know Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses With wet white trousers on And worlds collide as the evening continues The dignity fucks off Her

what you will require And still youve got to dance little liar Just like those fibs to pop and fizz And youll be forced to take that awful quiz And youre bound to trip And shell detect the fiction on your lips and dig a contradiction up And the clean coming will hurt And you can never get it spotless When theres dirt beneath the dirt The liar takes a lot less time Im sure its clear and plain to read Its not an alibi you need just yet Oh no its something for those beads of sweat Yes that will get you back to normal And after you have dabbed the patch Youll breathe and then proceed to scratch The varnish off that newly added calmness So as not to raise any alarms too soon And the clean coming will hurt And you can never get it spotless When theres dirt beneath the dirt The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter Have you got itchy bones And in all your time alone Can you hack your mind being riddled With the wrong memories Instrumental break And the clean coming will hurt And you can never get it spotless When theres dirt between the dirt Last night when my psyches Subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice You slowly dropped your eyelids When true love takes a grip it leaves you without a choice And in response to what you whispered in my ear I must admit sometimes I fantasise about you too The leader of the free world Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks Hes got him sen a theme tune They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring And in response to what you whispered in my ear I must admit sometimes I fantasise about you too In the daytime Bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies Summat else to publicise Im sure youve heard about enough So in response to what you whispered in my ear Ill be upfront sometimes I fantasise about you too Theres always somebody taller with more of a wit And hes equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he s fit And you just cant measure up though you dont have a prayer Wishing that youd made the most of her when she was there PreChorus Theyve got engaged theres no intention of a wedding Hes pinched your bird and hed probably kick your head in Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts Oh you re better off without her anyway You said you wasnt sad to see her go Yeah but I know you were though Now you dont know what shes up to you can only assume If shes not in the front of the shops then theyve gone to his room Bet shes gone round in her school stuff bet that s what he likes I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice PreChorus But shes not nice shes pretty fucking far from nice She s looking at you funny rarely looking at you twice Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts Oh you re better off without her anyway You said you wasnt sad to see her go Yeah but its clear you were though Have you heard what she has been doing Never did it for me He picks her up at the school gate at twenty past three She s been with all of the boys but never went very far And she wagged English and Science just to go in his car PreChorus Theyve got engaged theres no intention of a wedding Hes pinched me bird and hed probably kick my head in Oh now the girls have grown Yeah but Im sure that they still carry on in similar ways Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts Oh Im better off without her anyway I said I wasn t sad to see her go Yeah but I m only pretending you know Yeah I m only pretending you know I was only pretending you know I was only pretending you know I wrote I was here IDST On the bathroom mirror IDST IDST IDST IDST IDST IDST IDS T I wrote Mark for Jenny IDST With a drawing compass on the backseat IDST IDST IDST IDST IDST IDS T Instrumental break IDST IDST IDST IDS T The mirrors image tells me its home time But Im not finished cause youre not by my side And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin Carryin your shoes Decided that once again I was just dreamin Of bumpin into you Now its three in the mornin And Im tryna change your mind Left you multiple missed calls And to my message you reply Whyd you only call me when youre high Hi whyd you only call me when youre high Somewhere darker talkin the same shite I need a partner well are you out tonight Its harder and harder to get you to listen More I get through the gears Incapable of makin alright decisions And having bad ideas Now its three in the mornin And Im tryna change your mind Left you multiple missed calls And to my message you reply Message you reply Whyd you only call me when youre high Whyd you only call me when youre Hi whyd you only call me when youre high An I cant see you here wonderin where am I It sort of feels like Im runnin out of time I havent found all I was hopin to find You said you got to be up in the mornin Gonna have an early night An youre startin to bore me baby Whyd you only call me when youre high Whyd you only ever phone me when youre high Whyd you only ever phone me when youre high Whyd you only ever phone me when youre high Whyd you only ever phone me when youre high This house is a circus berserk as fuck We tend to see that as a perk though Look what its done to your friends Their memories are pretend And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end This house is a circus berserk as fuck We tend to see that as a perk though Look what its done to your friends Their memories are pretend And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end Theres a room full of trouble and theres lovers to be had Those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze And the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways And were forever unfulfilled and cant think why Like a search for murder clues in dead mans eyes Forever unfulfilled and cant think why Like a search for murder clues in dead mans eyes The more you open your mouth the more youre forcing performance And all the attention is leading me to feel important Gimme obnoxious gimme obnoxious now Now that were here we may as well go too far Wriggling around in incidents you wont forget Theres certainly some venom in the looks that you collect Aimlessly gazing at the faces in the queue And were struggling with the notion that its life not film 4 This house is a circus berserk as fuck Were forever unfulfilled We tend to see that as a perk though Cant think why Look what its done to your friends Their memories are pretend Like a search for murder clues And the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end My baby wants to drive the train But dont you let her well dont you let her touch the tracks I said my baby wants to drive the train Well all aboard yeah and dont forget to mind the gap PreChorus Dont you let her dont you know Shes sick and tired of Being in the background the passenger Let her drive the train oh Choochoo Why dont you let her drive the train Oh Choochoo Why dont you let her drive the train Yeah Shes setting off from platform four Make your way down well shut the door bout quart to five I said shes setting off from platform four And theyve decided that theyre gonna let her drive PreChorus Well dont you let her no dont you know Shes sick and tired of Being in the background the passenger Let her drive the train oh Choochoo Why dont you let her drive the train Oh Choochoo Why dont you let her drive my train Yeah woah Instrumental break Choochoo Choochoo Choochoo Choochoo Im pinned down by the dark Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep Yes Im battling that welltold gripe the most frustrating type You should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit Sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest And you make me wheeze then to my knees you do promote me Im pinned down by the dark ANIMAL Makes my head pirouette More than I would be willing to confess DANGEROUS The light it fidgets through the thoughtsll soon revert to you About as bashful as a tribal dance the first and final chance And of course the audience of frighteners and fiends Divided up into two teams When the acrobat fell off the beam she broke everyones heart Im pinned down by the dark ANIMAL Makes my head pirouette More than I would be willing to confess DANGEROUS DANGEROUS The most unsuitable pet Its been long enough now so lets Make a mess lioness Im pinned down by the dark Im pinned down by the dark ohohoh DANGEROUS ANIMAL DANGEROUS ANIMAL I want to see something that used to be in your eyes again Im waiting to see it You know its only a question of when And I know how much Im missing heaven You know that its missing And only you know Where you have been to Only you know What you have been through Theres better things Youre gonna get into And I wanna be there too I know its not easy for you to start to believe again And when the day comes dont let yourself be deceived again Cause I know how youve been waiting Such a long time that youve been waiting And only you know Where you have been to Only you know What you have been through Theres better things Youre gonna get into And I wanna be there too And I know how youve been waiting Such a long time that youve been waiting And only you know Where you have been to Only you know What you have been through Theres better things Youre gonna get into And I wanna be there too Just put your dukes up John Yeah put your dukes up John You were preened

summat in your teeth Are there some aces up your sleeve Have you no idea that youre in deep Ive dreamt about you nearly every night this week How many secrets can you keep Cause theres this tune I found That makes me think of you somehow an I play it on repeat Until I fall asleep spillin drinks on my settee PreChorus Do I wanna know If this feelin flows both ways Sad to see you go Was sorta hopin that you d stay Baby we both know That the nights were mainly made For sayin things that you cant say tomorrow day Crawlin back to you Ever thought of callin when Youve had a few Cause I always do Maybe Im too Busy bein yours To fall for somebody new Now Ive thought it through Crawlin back to you So have you got the guts Been wonderin if your hearts still open And if so I wanna know what time it shuts Simmer down an pucker up Im sorry to interrupt Its just Im constantly on the cusp of tryin to kiss you I dont know if you feel the same as I do But we could be together if you wanted to PreChorus Do I wanna know If this feelin flows both ways Sad to see you go Was sorta hopin that you d stay Baby we both know That the nights were mainly made For sayin things that you cant say tomorrow day Crawlin back to you Crawlin back to you Ever thought of callin when Youve had a few Had a few Cause I always do Cause I always do Maybe Im too Maybe I m too busy Busy bein yours Bein yours To fall for somebody new Now Ive thought it through Crawlin back to you Do I wanna know If this feelin flows both ways Sad to see you go Was sorta hopin that you d stay Baby we both know That the nights were mainly made For sayin things that you cant say tomorrow day Do I wanna know Too busy bein yours to fall Sad to see you go Ever thought of callin darlin Do I wanna know Do you want me crawlin back to you Space invaders flying home And theyre going to hit the sack And theyre probably going to die getting high Cause theyre mixing crazy moments with the crack And shes kissing all the boys Shes to clever to be slack But shes bound to go away for a day And shell like it so she wont be coming back Hook Baby baby baby Your good old days have died Baby baby baby Now wont you dry your pretty eyes Baby baby baby Your good old days are dead Come on Spot big bell bottom cords And a matching with a hat And youre a rule breaker baby Cant you see me standing only in your way to hit the sack And shes kissing all the boys Shes too clever to be slack But shes bound to go away for a day And shell like it so she wont be coming back Hook Baby baby baby Your good old days have died Baby baby baby Wont you dry your pretty eyes Baby baby baby Your good old days are dead Come on Break a mirror roll the dice Run with scissors through a chippan firefight Go into business with a grizzly bear But just dont sit down cause Ive moved your chair Find a wellknown hard man and start a fight Wear your shell suit on bonfire night Fill in a circular hole with a peg thats square But just dont sit down cause Ive moved your chair Oooh yeah yeah yeah Oooh yeah yeah yeah Bite the lightning and tell me how it tastes Kung fu fighting on your roller skates Do the Macarena in the devils lair But just dont sit down cause Ive moved your chair Oooh yeah yeah yeah Oooh yeah yeah yeah Oooh yeah yeah yeah Oooh yeah yeah yeah I want an interesting synonym To describe this thing That you say were all grandfathered in Ill use the search engine Weve got much to discuss Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls I can recall the glow of your low beams Its the big night in Tinsel City Life became a spectator sport I launch my fragrance called Integrity I sell the fact that I cant be bought Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole Through a handheld device I will flashback now and again but Im usually alright Thankfully the process has been simplified Since the last time you tried Ive recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times Ill be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold Making a selection opening credits roll Panoramic windows looking out across your soul You go in through the door Vengeance Trilogy wallpaper walls They have redecorated it all Theyve changed all the lights and the bars down the side Ive recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room Vehicles will pass by but I know when its you Ill be in a nose dive in my flying shoes Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth Ill be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold Making a selection opening credits roll
